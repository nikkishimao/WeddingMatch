<h1>Wedding Match</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Planning a wedding can be overwhelming. Couples have to choose a venue, see whether it has a liquor license, hire a caterer, decide on decor and flower arrangement, find a photographer or videographer, and choose entertainment like a DJ or band. Each of these elements affects the total cost of the wedding, which may in turn impact the number of guests the couple can invite. Without a centralized database, it becomes challenging to coordinate all of these elements and to ensure couples stay within budget. Vendors also encounter challenges. In a crowded market, it can be difficult for them to find clients, and to make their availability, prices, and services offered known to potential clients.

Wedding Match is a database for both clients and vendors/venues for managing wedding planning services. The system allows wedding planners to organize and manage all aspects of a wedding event including vendor details, client information, scheduling and budgeting. The system centralizes client and vendor information in a secure, easily accessible format; tracks budget, payments and deadlines; and provides a smooth communication channel for feedback, changes and updates between the client, planner and vendors. 

We match couples with vendors and venues to plan their perfect wedding, and give vendors and venues the opportunity to make their services, prices, and availability known to prospective clients. This wedding planner database will allow parties involved in the planned process (Vendors, Clients) to access relevant information in real-time. This allows for a more seamless experience on both ends, and should allow vendors to increase their business by reaching out to couples. Couples can query the system to find out which vendors are available in specific locations on a given date, and/or whether a vendor is willing to travel to their preferred location.

The primary end users of this database are couples seeking venues and specific services for their wedding; by using vendors whose information is in this system, couples can also ensure that the total cost of their wedding fits within their overall budget. Vendors can also use the system to reach out to prospective clients to offer their services, and to easily let potential clients know when they are and are not available.</p>
